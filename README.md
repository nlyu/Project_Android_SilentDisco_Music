# Build and Run
Make sure you have:
1. Latest spotify app install in your Android Phone (We use Spotify remote control so make sure you have a Spotify app running)
2. A spotify account (Need spotify verification)
3. Internet access (Firebase)

Install APK or build the app from Android Studio: 
1. APK [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lxTaWv8tzyM2yg0R1R06Apit_82knPjX/view?usp=sharing)
2. ```git clone https://github.com/cs160-spring2019/team-project-team04.git```
* If you run the app from Android Studio, make sure you build clean the project in the first time!
* Recommend to use Android Emulator Nexus 5X SDK 28

Run the app
1. Turn on your spotify app and login in to your spotify account.
2. Open silentdisco and register your account.
   Here are some existing example in our firebase for you:
   ```
   | account       | password |
   | ------------- | -------- |
   | nlyu2         | password |
   | cari          | password |
   ```
3. Login to the spotify API
4. Beause of the internet lag, there are very few chance that the app frezze in the chose party screen the first time you use this app. Simple reopen Silent Disco again and this problem should be solved.
5. You are good to go!
